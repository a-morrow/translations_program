# Translation_Program
Webscraping "https://context.reverso.net/translation/" for translations. 
Handles translations from English to a chosen language based on predefined list. Additional languages can be added if needed.
Utilizes Selenium for interacting with dynamic web pages and BeautifulSoup for scraping information.
Currently translations for cases like, 'Eat banana' are not supported because this returns two distinct translations and is not a common wording/phrase.
